In vivo 7T MRI dataset probing the auditory system (cortical and subcortical) collected at Maastricht University by Faruk Gulban, Federico De Martino, and Michelle Moerel. Includes two experiments: All ten participants have at least three sessions (Experiment 1), while six of these participants have an additional two sessions (Experiment 2).

Session 1: High resolution anatomical MRI; diffusion-weighted MRI; resting state fMRI; standard resolution anatomical MRI

Sessions 2 & 3: Standard resolution anatomical MRI; task functional MRI (Experiment 1; 10 of 10 participants)

Sessions 4 & 5: Standard resolution anatomical MRI; task functional MRI (Experiment 2; 6 of 10 participants)
